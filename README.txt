1.- Download the plugin zipfile from GitHub. 
2.- Unzip the file to your local computer.
3.- Rename the folder that was created to "englishcentral".

How to Add an English Central Activity to a Course
***********************************************
Go into Edit mode and from the "Add an Activity/Resource" popup, choose to add an English Central mod.

* Give your activity a name, and a description(optional). 

* Specify the Video title. This is not used anywhere, it is just to help you remember which video you selected.

* Specify the Video ID. To get this you will need to visit English Central and find the video you wish. The ID can be found in the URL for the activity on English Central.

If you have questions please contact the developer, me, Justin Hunt at poodllsupport @ gmail. com
